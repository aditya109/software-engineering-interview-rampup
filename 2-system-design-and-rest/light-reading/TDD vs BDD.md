# TDD vs BDD

----

## TDD

### What is TDD ??

- Iterative development process
- Every iteration starts with a set of tests written for a new piece of functionality
- Test Cases are created before code is written
- TDD instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed

### What are the main benefits of TDD ?

- Small regression suite
- Development is test first ==> Reduction in bugs
- TDD is used to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.
- Avoids duplication of code
- Refactoring improves the code
- TDD drive the code design and approach
- Unit test cases are covered early

### Disadvantages of TDD

- Modify/Add a Test as requirement comes in
- Write bug -fixes if test fails

### Process of TDD

Add Test

Execute

Write Code

Repeat

## BDD == Selenium Testing

### What is BDD ?

Evolved from TDD, tests are more user-focused and based on the system's behaviour.

### Main Features of BDD

- Encouraging collaboration across roles to build shared understanding of the problem to be solved
- Producing system documentation that is automatically checked against the system's behaviour
- Working in rapid, small iterations to increase feedback and the flow of the value

### Benefits of BDD

- Convert simple requirements to testcases
- Tests written in cucumber directly interact with the development code
- When this and then this should happen 
- Easy to understand by the business stakeholders
- Remove ambiguities in to the code
