# Clean Code

The phenomenon of self-realization of impediment by bad code is called wading.

## The Total Code of Owning a mess

As messy code builds up, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero. As productivity decreases, management does the only thing they can; they add more staff in hopes of increasing productivity. But that new staff is versed in the design of the system. They don't know the difference between a change that matches the design intent and a change that thwarts the design intent. Furthermore, they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero.

## What is Clean Code

> *"I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The <u>logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide</u>, the <u>dependencies minimal for ease in maintenance</u>, <u>error handling complete</u> according to an articulated strategy, and <u>performance close to optimal</u> so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well."*  --- **Bjanrne Stroustrup, inventor of *C++* and author of *The C++ Programming Language***

> *"Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control."* --- **Grady Booch, author of *Object Oriented Analysis* and *Design with Applications***

> *"Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clean and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone."* --- **"Big" Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of eclipse strategy**

> *"I could list all the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overlapping quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were though about by the code's author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you're led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you-- code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft."* --- **Micheal Feathers, author of *Working Effectively with Legacy Code***

> *"In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck's rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code:*
>
> - *Runs all the tests;* 
> - *Contains no duplication;*
> - *Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;*
> - *Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.*
>
> *........Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions. That's what make clean code for me."* --- **Ron Jeffries, author of *Extreme Programming Installed* and *Extreme Programming Adventures in C#***

> *"You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like language was made for the problem."* --- **Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki, inventor of Fit, coinventor of *eXtreme Programming*, Motive force behind Design Patterns, Smalltalk and OO thought leader. The godfather of all those who care about code.**

## We are the Authors

The code has to be kept clean over time, remember the boy scout rule.

> *Leave the campground, cleaner than you found it.*

Can you imagine working on a project where the code *simply got better* as time passed ?
