# Introduction

Heuristic is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect or rationalized but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation.

It is not the heuristic between themselves that are valuable, it is the relationship between those heuristics and the discrete decisions we made while cleaning up the code in the case studies.
