    Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  
    For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  
    Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.
    
    The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  
    For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.
    For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.
    Example 1:

    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
