# Linked List II

## Problem

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
Function findCycleTailInLinkedList
	Pass In: head
	slow = head
	fast = head
	while fast != None and fast.next != None
    	fast = fast.next.next
    	slow = slow.next
    	if fast == slow
    		slow = head
    		while slow != fast
    			fast = fast.next
                slow = slow.next
	Pass Out: slow
```
