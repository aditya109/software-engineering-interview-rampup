# Cycle in Circular Array

## Problem

You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward**, and
- If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

Since the array is **circular**, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

- Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
- Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
- `k > 1`

Return `true` *if there is a **cycle** in* `nums`*, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...
The cycle's length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because the sequence's length is 1.
By definition the sequence's length must be strictly greater than 1 to be a cycle.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-1,-2,-2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because nums[1] is positive, but nums[2] is negative.
Every nums[seq[j]] must be either all positive or all negative.
```

## Solution 

**Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
Function circularArrayLoop
	Pass In: nums
	
	
	Pass Out:
```
