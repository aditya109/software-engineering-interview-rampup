    Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
    
    The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
    This path may or may not pass through the root.
    
    The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
    
    Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
    
    Example 2:
    Input: root = [1,2]
    Output: 1
